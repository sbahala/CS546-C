                    <h3>Waterfall Safety</h3>
                    <p>When visiting the waterfalls, stick to the designated pathways and viewport places. The rocks may be extremely slippery.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Wear Appropriate Clothing</h3>
                    <p>Be prepared to get wet! Even on sunny days, the mist from the falls can soak your clothes. Wearing quick-dry fabrics and bringing a waterproof jacket is advisable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Make Reservations for Attractions in Advance</h3>
                    <p>Popular attractions like the Maid of the Mist boat tour sell out quickly, especially in the summer. Book your tickets online in advance to ensure you don't miss out on these unforgettable experiences.</p>

                    <h3>Footwear Matters</h3>
                    <p>When touring the falls, expect to do a lot of walking, so bring appropriate, water-resistant footwear. Shoes with adequate grip are necessary since slippery areas are frequent.</p>

                    <h3>Appropriate Time to Visit</h3>
                    <p>Although Niagara Falls is breathtaking all year long, summertime gives the ideal weather for enjoying the falls and the surrounding sights. However, it's also the peak season, so plan to visit on weekdays early in the morning to avoid the crowds.</p>
                </li>               
                <li>
                    <h3>Stay Hydrated</h3>
                    <p>There will be a lot of walking and if you are visiting in summer, heat can be harsh. Refillable water bottles are easy to carry and will help you remain hydrated all day. Refill stations can be found all across the park.</p>
