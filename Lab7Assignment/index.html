            <h2>Niagara Falls</h2>
            <p>Niagara Falls, waterfall on the Niagara River in northeastern North America, one of the continent's most famous spectacles.The falls lie on the border between Ontario, Canada, and  NewYork state, U.S. For many decades the falls were an attraction for tourists and for such stunts as walking over the falls on a tightrope or going over them in a barrel. Increasingly, however, the appeal of the site has become its beauty and uniqueness as a physical phenomenon.</p>
            <p>This geological wonder is not only one of the most popular tourist attractions in the state of NewYork,  but also functions as one of the major power providers to the state itself. Comprised of three waterfalls - American Falls, Horseshoe Falls and Bridal Veil Falls. Niagara Falls water stems from the upper Great Lakes and the river is estimated to be 12,000 years old. The wonder of the falls intrigued many and has prompted daredevils to "conquer" the falls in various contraptions from wooden barrels to rubber balls.</p>
            <p>Niagara Falls consists of two water falls on the Niagara River, which marks the border between NewYork and Ontario, Canada: The American Falls, located on the American side of the border, and the Canadian or Horseshoe Falls located on  the Canadian side. To the right of the American Falls is a smaller waterfall that has been separated from the American Falls by natural forces, which is usually called as the Bridal veil Falls.</p>
            <p>I visited Niagara falls in May 2023 and it was a beautiful experience for me. I could see the huge waterfall which I used to see in images and videos. I went on the boat ride where I went very close to the falls, the water droplets on face made me feel very energetic and reviving. Besides that I also went to visit other islands and near by tourist places.</p>
            <p>One must definitely not miss when they go to Niagara falls like:</p>

            <h2>Ricketts Glen State Park</h2>
            <p>Ricketts Glen State Park, located in the centre of Pennsylvania, is a natural sanctuary highlighted for its gorgeous waterfalls, challenging hiking routes, and calm fishing locations. During my recent visit, the park's 13,050 acres offered an immersive trip into the heart of nature, attracting both nature lovers and casual visitors.</p>
            <p>The green blanket of old-growth forest with a challenging yet rewarding walk was quite pleasant. Though all the trails were challenging but Ganoga Falls, the highest, falls spectacularly at 94 feet. Hiking there was more than simply workout, and all in all it was an inspirational adventure.</p>
            <p>The area around Ricketts Glen is filled with activities which increases the attraction of a trip there. Notable nearby destinations include:</p>
